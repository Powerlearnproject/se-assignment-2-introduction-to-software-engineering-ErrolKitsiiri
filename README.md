4. Requirements Validation: Ensuring the documented requirements meet the needs of stakeholders and are achievable within the project constraints.
5. Requirements Management: Tracking and managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle to ensure alignment with project goals and constraints.


Software Design Principles:
f. Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve the maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is a design principle that involves dividing a software system into smaller, self-contained units or modules, each with a specific functionality. Each module is designed to perform a distinct part of the system's overall function and can be developed, tested, and maintained independently of the others.

Benefits of Modularity
1. Maintainability:
Isolation of Changes: Changes made in one module are less likely to impact other modules, making it easier to manage and update the software.
Simplified Debugging: Easier to identify and fix issues within isolated modules.
Code Reusability: Modules can be reused across different projects or parts of the same project.
2. Scalability:
Independent Development: Different teams can work on different modules simultaneously, accelerating development.
Easier Upgrades: Individual modules can be upgraded or replaced without affecting the entire system.
Load Distribution: Modules can be distributed across multiple servers or systems to balance the load and improve performance.

Testing in Software Engineering:
g. Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit Testing:
Tests individual components or modules in isolation.
Verifies that each unit performs as expected.
Typically automated and executed by developers.
2. Integration Testing:
Tests the interaction between integrated units or modules.
Ensures that combined units work together correctly.
Identifies interface issues and integration bugs.
3. System Testing:
Tests the entire software system as a whole.
Validates functional and non-functional requirements.
Conducted in an environment similar to the production environment.
4. Acceptance Testing:
Validates that the software meets business requirements.
Conducted by end-users or stakeholders.
Ensures that the software is ready for deployment.

Importance of Testing in Software Development
1. Identify Defects: Testing helps in uncovering defects and errors in the software, ensuring that it functions correctly and meets requirements.

2. Ensure Quality: Testing ensures that the software meets quality standards, performs reliably, and delivers a positive user experience.
